# completingway
A plugin for Final Fantasy 14, to be used within FFXIV Dalamud Launcher, that allows users to track progress towards their achievements in a compact and unobtrusive UI window.


Stretch Goals:
- Implement a "soft-update" system for some metrics, like the “Participate in X sanctioned chocobo races.” that detects goal-specific events (in this instance, winning a chocobo race) and increments the progress window accordingly. This should reduce the frequency of requests to open up the official Achievement log window to fetch the data.
- Once all the achievements are done and included in this (it'll probably become release 1.0.0.0 at that stage), I'll look at adding currencies and some more "wishlist"-type stuff, like "Earn 2,000,000 MGP for Sabotender Mount", etc.
- Post full release, would like to add a function that fetches mount/minion/orchestrion data from lalachievements/ffxivcollect/xivapi/lodestone/the actual game UI and allows users to add certain collectibles to their Completingway wishlist.
